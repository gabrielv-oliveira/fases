This is a simple web application for managing a todo list. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete todos, as well as mark them as completed.

Usage
The main screen of the application displays a list of all todos. To add a new todo, simply type a description of the task in the input field at the top of the screen and press the "Add" button. To edit or delete an existing todo, click the corresponding button next to the todo you want to modify.

When you've completed a task, you can mark it as complete by clicking the checkbox next to the todo. Completed todos will be moved to the bottom of the list and displayed with a line through the text.
